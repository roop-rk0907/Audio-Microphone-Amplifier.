# Audio-Microphone-Amplifier.
# Audio-Microphone Amplifier with ESP32 and Custom PCB

This project is an audio-microphone amplifier built using the ESP32 microcontroller. The design includes custom-fabricated PCBs and a successful test using an oscilloscope.

## Project Overview

The amplifier takes input from a microphone, amplifies the signal using carefully selected components, and displays the output signal on an oscilloscope. The project demonstrates the integration of hardware components like resistors, capacitors, and potentiometers, along with custom PCB design and fabrication.

### Key Components:
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Used for signal processing and control.
- **Microphone**: Captures audio signals for amplification.
- **Resistors, Capacitors, Potentiometer**: Standard electronic components used for filtering and amplification.
- **Custom PCB**: Designed and fabricated to integrate all components efficiently.
- **Oscilloscope**: Used to verify the amplified signal and performance of the amplifier.

## Schematic and PCB Design

The circuit was designed physically on breadboard and each time I make the connections I make the changes of the errors i got and fabricated using a PCB manufacturer. 


## Assembly and Testing

Once the PCB was fabricated, I assembled it using:
- Resistors (value)
- Capacitors (value)
- Potentiometer (value)
- Microphone module

The assembled board was tested using an oscilloscope, and the results showed a clean amplified signal. You can find images of the oscilloscope readings in the `images/` directory.
